# Simulation Output

This directory contains output from all of our simulations. We us the following naming convention:

```
<simulation>_<date>.nc
```

* `<simualation>` is the name of the simulation and the code for it is located at `./simulations/simulation.jl`
* `<date>` is the the date the output was generated
